# Thesis CLI Wrapper

The thesis script is a Bash function that serves as a command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for common tasks related to my thesis project. It centralizes the most important thesis-related actions, providing a streamlined and user-friendly way to manage ROS 2 workspace.

## Current Arguments

The script can be invoked with one of two arguments:

1. `build`
2. `newpackage <package_name>`
3. `thesis run <node-name>`
